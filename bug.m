In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Consider the scenario where you have a class 'MyClass' with a property 'data' that's a strong reference to another object: 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSData *data;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (instancetype)initWithData:(NSData *)data {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        self.data = data; //Potential issue here
    }
    return self;
}
@end
```

If the 'data' object is created within the initializer, but then you create the  'MyClass' object and assign it to a variable, if  the variable is not also retained elsewhere , after this line self.data = data; is executed, data's reference count may become zero and it may be deallocated. If later you try to use this data, your app may crash due to attempting to access deallocated memory, resulting in a EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash.
